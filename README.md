# UNP_PROJECT_BI-WITH_POWER_BI_HR_ATTRITION_DATA_ANALYSIS

I completed a HR employee attrition data analysis project in collaboration with UNP using real world HR employee data. The project involved cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing HR employee attrition data using Microsoft Power BI. I developed an interactive dashboard to examine key factors influencing employee turnover such as age, salary, job role, education, and years at the company. The report highlights important metrics including attrition rate, average income, job satisfaction, and tenure distribution. Interactive visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, KPIs, and slicers were used to generate meaningful business insights. The dashboard helps identify high-attrition departments and demographic patterns contributing to employee exits. This project enhanced my skills in data cleaning, data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design, while enabling data-driven decision-making for improving employee retention strategies.
